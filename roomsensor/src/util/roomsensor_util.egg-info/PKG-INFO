RoomSensor Serial Utilities
===========================

Python utilities to interact with the RoomSensor ESP32S3 over the serial console for programming, debugging, and testing.

Quickstart
----------

1) Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2) Install package (editable) and dev deps

```bash
pip install -e .
```

3) Run tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

Port selection
--------------

By default the library auto-selects the first serial port whose name or description contains "usbserial". You can override with environment variable `ROOMSENSOR_SERIAL_PORT` or by passing `port="/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX"` to the class.

Notes
-----

- On connect, the library performs a hardware reset using RTS/DTR to place the device in a known state.
- All output is captured in an in-memory buffer and also logged to the console for debugging.
